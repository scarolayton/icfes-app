## Icfes App
The ICFES Trivia App is an engaging and educational web application designed to challenge and test users' knowledge on various subjects 
      with questions provided by the ICFES (Instituto Colombiano para la Evaluación de la Educación).
      This dynamic quiz platform was meticulously crafted using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, creating a seamless and responsive user experience. 
      The app offers various quiz categories, each containing ICFES questions.  Users can create accounts or sign in to the app using their Google accounts. 
      The app leverages the power of Supabase, a secure and scalable database, to store questions and user data.  The app maintains leaderboards that display the top users in 
      terms of points and achievements  Built with Next.js, the app takes advantage of server-side rendering for enhanced performance. Tailwind CSS provides a streamlined and 
      attractive user interface.
